# What is ORP?
ORP (Open Rich Presence) is a standard for implementing Rich Presence into applications. 

# What is Rich Presence?
Rich Presence (let's call it *RP* from here on out) enables applications to show the status of a user in a **rich**, engaging way. These small, space efficient pieces of UI contain information about users' current activies in real time, making *RP* perfect for socially driven applications such as [Discord](https://discordapp.com/rich-presence).

# If Rich Presence already exists, why do we need ORP?
We live in a connected world. More and more applications are offering the means of connecting to one or many external services in order to provide additional functionality. Yet, even so, very few applications have implemented *RP*. Why? Well, we believe this is because current implementations of *RP* are application specific, meaning each application's *RP* requires custom integration from app developers. This is not sustainable and the core idea behind ORP is to standardise this process, allowing app developers to integrate *RP* once, automatically supporting any ORP compatible application. Pretty neat, right? We think so.
